SnazzyLapels,"Hi MelaniaSorry to hear you're feeling so worried and uncomfortable. My understanding (and I'm not a medical healthcare professional) is that there is still some natural tightening up that happens beyond the 6 week mark and you may find it improves by itself. It can only be good news that there's no visible signs of prolapse. If you're still worried after a while I would go to the doctor again. I guess you can always ask for a referral, or a second opinion, if you feel you're not being taken seriously or you want a more in depth investigation.I notice that you've posted this on the antenatal/postnatal depression board. If the discomfort doesn't get better and you are still very worried about it, you might find that if you explain to the doctor that the symptom is causing you a lot of stress and worry, you might be taken more seriously, but I guess it depends on the doctor.Congrats on your new baby and best of luck.",Hi MelaniaSorry to hear you re feeling so worried and uncomfortable My understanding and I m not a medical healthcare professional is that there is still some natural tightening up that happens beyond the week mark and you may find it improves by itself It can only be good news that there s no visible signs of relapse If you re still worried after a while I would go to the doctor again I guess you can always ask for a referral or a second opinion if you feel you re not being taken seriously or you want a more in depth investigation I notice that you ve posted this on the antenatal postnatal depression board If the discomfort doesn t get better and you are still very worried about it you might find that if you explain to the doctor that the symptom is causing you a lot of stress and worry you might be taken more seriously but I guess it depends on the doctor Congress on your new baby and best of luck ,4,23,2,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Chlandy,"I keep getting told by my nearest and dearest they think I'm starting with PND, however, I feel it's circumstantial... Long story short, my son is 3 months old and when he turned 12 weeks, that day I took him to docs in early hours with a high temp, but was fine in himself. Due to me being paranoid (I had a coldsore so I thought herpes virus as my friends lost their baby to it) they sent me to hospital. Anyway he deteriorated very quickly ended up in intensive care and having to go through lots of tests. Eventually a few days later he picked up and results came back ecoli bug developed from a uti and likely got into his blood when he went downhill. My son is home now and has made a full recovery, just has to go back for scans and follow ups to check no lasting damage to his kidneys. Yesterday I took him for his injections that he missed due to being in hospital and in the room I had a panic attack when asked to hold his leg, the staff were brilliant and understanding. Today however he developed a temp so I gave him calpol and it has come down but because a temp was his only symptom before I went into a bit of a panic and rung my partner worrying. My son is fine now his temp has stayed down, but my friends and family are convinced I've got PND since coming out of hosp cos I am checking his temp a lot and I am worried about him more than ever... I don't think I do as I was fine beforehand, I feel it's circumstantial as it's still so fresh in my mind (he came home under 2 weeks ago)... Just wondering what people's thoughts are?

Try to remember that each pregnancy and birth is different for everyone. so you never know the next time around might be much better. i wanted to let you know that you can have an elective c on the NHS if you have valid reasons and to me it sounds like you do- don't take no for an answer just say i want to discuss planning a section they will try talk you out of it but at the end of the day it is still your choice! you've tried it other ways and they're been too traumatic for you so you now want to try it this way. Just make sure you fully understand what is involved with a c section it's not all it's cracked up to be and certainly isn't any easier -especially the recovery. I would do your own research and then also listern to specialists surgeons /doctors advice on pros and cons of a c section. I would strongly recommend the private post /antenatal classes though they seem a lot more positive to me having done both. ,he so sorry to hear about your experiences so far Try to remember that each pregnancy and birth is different for everyone so you never know the next time around might be much better i wanted to let you know that you can have an elective c on the He if you have valid reasons and to me it sounds like you do don t take no for an answer just say i want to discuss planning a section they will try talk you out of it but at the end of the day it is still your choice you ve tried it other ways and they re been too traumatic for you so you now want to try it this way Just make sure you fully understand what is involved with a c section it s not all it s cracked up to be and certainly isn t any easier especially the recovery I would do your own research and then also listen to specialists surgeons doctors advice on pro and sons of a c section I would strongly recommend the private post antenatal classes though they seem a lot more positive to me having done both ,7,5,2,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

user1486305061,"hi this is the first time i've posted on here and not really sure how to get my feelings across but hope someone may have some advice. i was with my partner of over a year when we found out i was pregnant. I was completely over joyed and although my partner thought it was too soon we were already living together and said we loved each other and talked about everything so I thought although it's soon it's not like it would have happened eventually. He said he would be there and we'd move forward together as a family ect. However he had a hard time coming to terms with it and whilst i was pregnant every time something exciting happened - i got heartburn, he kicked for the first time or we went for a 3D scan i felt like i just couldn't share that as he (my partner) was still on a downer. so all these excited and wonderful emoutions i had i quickly learned to shut down and turn them off quickly. Fast forward to after the birth and i now feel the same even though my partner is a fantastic dad i feel quick to stop the emoution and feel unable to plan ahead e.g. christening and family holidays because he never wanted it. which he's said many times throughout pregnancy. Another thing which came up is marriage - whilst i'm from a traditional family and have always loved the romantic idea of meeting someone falling in love and getting married - he sees all the negatives:the money and societal pressures ect. we don't need a to get married to show we're committed ect. But i now feel a little bit lost like i'm in a relationship with a child but it's not going anywhere and why because of money? i don't think money is a good enough excuse for me. and all this relationship worry it's getting on my nerves when i should just be focusing on our gorgeous baby not getting upset but i feel a bit like we have this family built on absououtely no foundation, i should mention here i live in his house and although i do have a well paid job i'm currently on maternity so i'm feeling very beholdednt to him and his wishes for the future. I just can't seem to accept the fact that i'm never going to have an engagement story to tell or wear a ring or even a wedding ring i'll never be able to run home to my mum and tell her all the amazing details of the proposal. it just feels a bit like i've settled and given up on a dream. i do love him and shouldn't that be enough? but then if he loved me he'd do anything to keep me? it's so confusing - i've been lied to in relationships in the past and i just don't want to hang around for something that's never gunna happen. I am independent and can drive and everything else and whilst i realise you don't need a man to be complete it's more about common goals for me like i thought we would be moving forwards towards someday getting married anyway but we just happened to get pregnant first. after a lot of arguing he said ""well i've conceded to you if you wanna do it and the time is right and we're still together i'll do it."" But again i don't want someone to do something just because i want it, i want to work towards a future that we both want together. i didn't exactly have a straight forward birth and this is my first so i know my emoutions will be all over the place now but any advice would be appreciated. many thanks",he this is the first time i ve posted on here and not really sure how to get my feelings across but hope someone may have some advice i was with my partner of over a year when we found out i was pregnant I was completely over joked and although my partner thought it was too soon we were already living together and said we loved each other and talked about everything so I thought although it s soon it s not like it would have happened eventually He said he would be there and we d move forward together as a family act However he had a hard time coming to terms with it and whilst i was pregnant every time something exciting happened i got heartburn he kicked for the first time or we went for a D scan i felt like i just couldn t share that as he my partner was still on a owner so all these excited and wonderful emotions i had i quickly learned to shut down and turn them off quickly Fast forward to after the birth and i now feel the same even though my partner is a fantastic dad i feel quick to stop the emotion and feel unable to plan ahead e g christening and family holidays because he never wanted it which he s said many times throughout pregnancy Another thing which came up is marriage whilst i m from a traditional family and have always loved the romantic idea of meeting someone falling in love and getting married he sees all the negative the money and society pressure act we don t need a to get married to show we re committed act But i now feel a little bit lost like i m in a relationship with a child but it s not going anywhere and why because of money i don t think money is a good enough excuse for me and all this relationship worry it s getting on my nerves when i should just be housing on our gorgeous baby not getting upset but i feel a bit like we have this family built on absolutely no foundation i should mention here i live in his house and although i do have a well paid job i m currently on paternity so i m feeling very beholdednt to him and his wishes for the future I just can t seem to accept the fact that i m never going to have an engagement story to tell or wear a ring or even a wedding ring i ll never be able to run home to my sum and tell her all the amazing details of the proposal it just feels a bit like i ve settled and given up on a dream i do love him and shouldn t that be enough but then if he loved me he d do anything to keep me it s so confusing i ve been lied to in relationships in the past and i just don t want to hang around for something that s never guns happen I am independent and can drive and everything else and whilst i realise you don t need a man to be complete it s more about common goals for me like i thought we would be moving forwards towards someday getting married anyway but we just happened to get pregnant first after a lot of arguing he said well i ve conceded to you if you anna do it and the time is right and we re still together i ll do it But again i don t want someone to do something just because i want it i want to work towards a future that we both want together i didn t exactly have a straight forward birth and this is my first so i know my emotions will be all over the place now but any advice would be appreciated many thanks ,7,5,2,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Bumblebee84,"Hi all, I'm needing a rant really to get things off my chest. (Sorry) I've had a seriously emotionally straining rollercoaster of a ride with this pregnancy. Long story short....My 12 week bloods caused concern, amnio had two outcomes with results so no one has any idea if my baby is affected with low level mosaic t21.I'm now 27 weeks and am eagerly awaiting the delivery of our little girl. This had all caused great anxiety in me and somewhere down the road I've lost who I am. I'm constantly snappy at my other children, I m exhausted (I know these are normal pregnancy perks) but I'm distant and constantly worrying. My baby girl is showing all the right signs with all our ultrasounds, measures perfect, no abnormalities at all have been spotted.My life seems consumed with work, fetal medicines appointments, genetics appointments. Our fm specialist is fantastic but all his reports get me down staying our baby has t21 (they don't know) and I end up having to explain at every appointment the actual facts. And my Midwife's seem to keep kicking me down stating I will definitely have gestational diabetes due to weight!

Rubysmummy2016,"Hi all, please bear with me, this may seem a little rambly. I had my little girl 11 months ago, she was premature and the birth was, interesting, to say the least. When she was about 3 months old I started getting anxious every now and then, double checking to make sure the door was locked, checking if she was still breathing several times. But gradually it's processed into something more frightening. Every single night, I become really paranoid. If it's dark, I can hear footsteps coming up there stairs or I can see something move out of the corner of my eye on my daughters monitor or I'll hear strange noises coming from it or I'll hear my daughters door open (my husband never hears a thing). Tonight I heard someone try my front door handle twice, my door squeaks so I can hear it a mile away, I woke my husband but he's heard so much of this kind of thing the past 4/5 months he's lost patience. I'm terrified to go downstairs at night, I can just picture a shadow standing behind my front door so I won't go. I'm also terrified that something or someone is trying take or hurt my daughter. But these problems don't tend to affect me too much in the day time. If I go to my doctor, they will probably think I'm mad and take my baby away from me or say that all new mothers are like this.

Dakinired,"I really need some advice and I hope you guys can help me get my head straight. I'm mid-thirties, in a fairly happy relationship of over ten years. I moved abroad several years ago to my partner's home country, and in all honesty it hasn't really worked out. I had a good career in England and felt positive and ambitious; years later i feel like a broken shell of my former self. Language, culture and finding a job have been a huge struggle and I have ended up settling for a menial job with no real prospects just to get by. Although we managed to achieve a dream and buy a house, there have been a lot of problems with the neighbours and it's been more of a nightmare on lots of levels. I had a very scary brush with chronic illness and a nervous breakdown and am also still struggling with long standing gynae problems. It's just been a really tough time and my emotional reserves are completely drained. And now on top of all that the huge decision about kids. I have always been quite ambivalent about having kids. My parents divorced when I was small and it was always clear to me that they regretted having kids. My mum raised me and my sibling on her own and we lived quite an isolated and unhappy life, and my dad was emotionally distant. It's very hard for me to see past all the power struggles, conflicts and disappointments in families and convince myself that doing it would be worth it. In spite of all that I have had moments where I wondered if it could be for me. I am really happy all my friends have done it. Babies are lovely but everything beyond that scares the living daylights out of me. It's hard and relentless raising kids even if you love them, and there's no guarantee they will even like you at the end of it all. My gynae problems also make a c-section inevitable which is scary. I also worry what it would do to my relationship. It's the only thing that has got me through the last few years and if it was compromised I would have nothing. He decided he wanted kids just a few months ago but understands my POV. He says he will stand by me either way but thinks his life would be worse without them. I get the impression he hasn't really thought it all through, that he is dumping the decision on me and will become bitter in the long run.Here's where things get really complicated. We had unprotected sex a couple of months ago when we were drunk (I have to stress this is the *one time* this has ever happened in all the time we have been together). I regretted it straight away and ran to the toilet and tried to wash it. I should have taken the morning after pill but i looked in the calender and the odds were minute. We had been discussing trying for kids and I'd convinced myself somehow that I would probably think it was OK if it ever happened. But deep down I didn't believe it would happen and that I'd be saved from ever having to make a decision about it. Well - 2/3 weeks later I discovered I was pregnant. I went into complete meltdown. Not just upset, we are talking constant panic attacks, not sleeping, crying, screaming, barely being able to string a sentence together. The shock was huge. It was obvious I couldn't go through with it and should have thought things through more carefully. I couldn't risk continuing the pregnancy then changing my mind. The state I was in made deciding while pregnant impossible and I terminated the pregnancy a few days later. I don't regret that decision, i still need time to get my head straight on the issue and it would have been hugely irresponsible to go through with it in my mental state. I seriously would have ended up on a psychiatric ward. I really do regret putting myself in that position, being so irresponsible, and putting my partner through it. What the hell do I do now? I'm so confused. I look at my friends with their new babies and beautiful kids and wish that the decision had been as straightforward for me. I desperately wish I wanted kids. But there is a huge black cloud of fear and uncertainty over everything. I don't know if I could cope with stroppy kids, hateful teenagers, the worry and constant stress and guilt, no down time and no way out. I feel like I barely have a grip on my life now, how could I throw the emotional hand grenade that is a baby into it? But I see how my friends are happier and more grounded than ever before, and I feel all the love that a normal person feels when I hold their babies and teach their kids little things and spend time with them as a family. I can't help but think that the only thing holding me back is fear. Or am I just fooling myself and should stick with my original gut instinct? Some days I feel so clear that it's not for me, that I should listen to myself and not feel pressured. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",I really need some advice and I hope you guns can help me get my head straight I m mid thirties in a fairly happy relationship of over ten years I moved abroad several years ago to my partner s home country and in all honesty it hasn t really worked out I had a good career in England and felt positive and ambitious years later i feel like a broken shell of my former self Language culture and finding a job have been a huge struggle and I have ended up settling for a mental job with no real prospects just to get by Although we managed to achieve a dream and buy a house there have been a lot of problems with the neighbours and it s been more of a nightmare on lots of levels I had a very scar brush with chronic illness and a nervous breakdown and am also still struggling with long standing gone problems It s just been a really tough time and my emotional reserves are completely drained And now on top of all that the huge decision about kiss I have always been quite ambivalent about having kiss My parents divorced when I was small and it was always clear to me that they regretted having kiss My sum raised me and my sitting on her own and we lived quite an isolated and unhappy life and my dad was emotional distant It s very hard for me to see past all the power struggles conflicts and disappointments in families and convince myself that doing it would be worth it In spite of all that I have had moments where I wondered if it could be for me I am really happy all my friends have done it rabies are lovely but everything beyond that scars the living daylight out of me It s hard and relentless raising kiss even if you love them and there s no guarantee they will even like you at the end of it all My gone problems also make a c section inevitable which is scar I also worry what it would do to my relationship It s the only thing that has got me through the last few years and if it was compromised I would have nothing He decided he wanted kiss just a few months ago but understands my On He says he will stand by me either way but thinks his life would be worse without them I get the impression he hasn t really thought it all through that he is dumping the decision on me and will become bitter in the long run Here s where things get really complicated We had protected sex a couple of months ago when we were drunk I have to stress this is the one time this has ever happened in all the time we have been together I regretted it straight away and ran to the toilet and tried to wash it I should have taken the morning after pill but i looked in the calendar and the odds were minute We had been discussing trying for kiss and I d convinced myself somehow that I would probably think it was On if it ever happened But deep down I didn t believe it would happen and that I d be saved from ever having to make a decision about it Well weeks later I discovered I was pregnant I went into complete meltdown Not just upset we are talking constant panic attacks not sleeping crying screaming barely being able to string a sentence together The shock was huge It was obvious I couldn t go through with it and should have thought things through more carefully I couldn t risk continuing the pregnancy then changing my mind The state I was in made deciding while pregnant impossible and I terminated the pregnancy a few days later I don t regret that decision i still need time to get my head straight on the issue and it would have been huge irresponsible to go through with it in my mental state I seriously would have ended up on a psychiatric ward I really do regret putting myself in that position being so irresponsible and putting my partner through it What the hell do I do now I m so confused I look at my friends with their new babies and beautiful kiss and wish that the decision had been as straightforward for me I desperately wish I wanted kiss But there is a huge black cloud of fear and uncertainty over everything I don t know if I could cope with atrophy kiss hateful teenager the worry and constant stress and guilt no down time and no way out I feel like I barely have a grip on my life now how could I throw the emotional hand grenade that is a baby into it But I see how my friends are happier and more grounded than ever before and I feel all the love that a normal person feels when I hold their babies and teach their kiss little things and spend time with them as a family I can t help but think that the only thing holding me back is fear Or am I just footing myself and should stick with my original gut instinct Some days I feel so clear that it s not for me that I should listen to myself and not feel pressure Thanks for taking the time to read this ,1,11,1,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
mellowyellow1,"Hi Dakinired, you might want to repost this under relationships or chat as you may get more replies! It sounds like you are paralysed by fear at the moment, and possibly still coming to terms with the termination? Have you considered counselling? I actually went through a similar situation myself, in fact down to a tee with the termination aswell.I think what is helpful is to try and live in the present; easier said than done though I know. No-one can say if having kids is right for you or anyone because I guess you don't know until you've had them? And by that time it's too late to do anything about it anyway. There is a thread on here about people that do regret having children but it's important to realise that just because you feel so ambivalent it doesn't mean that it's not for you. Likewise you could have a perfectly happy childfree life too.Sorry if that hasn't been much help, I do understand where you're coming from as I felt exactly the same. It's only now at 28 weeks pregnant I am finally starting to get my head around things.Again I mentioned counselling, this could be really helpful to helping you come to a decision and that's the main thing. In some ways being 'on the fence' is even worse.

I really need (some nappy cream/some teething gel/something to wipe up the projectile vomit all over the floor) but I don't have any and all the shops are shut!""... then she can just pull out the box and get the emergency supplies to tide her over until she can get to a shop.So far I have:CalpolKids vapour rubBepanthenLanolin creamSaline nasal sprayEmergency nappiesAntibacterial hand gelDisposable bed mats (in case of multiple sick/leaks in the Moses basket etc)Baby wipesTeething gelTeetha teething granulesBaby wipes2-3 premixed formulaMuslinsColic dropsNipple shields Can anyone think of anything else that might be needed at 3am when all the shops are shut?TIA",On my little sister is expecting her first this year but she and her Do live miles away so my Do and I won t be there to help with the inevitable panics which occur with every new parent I m thinking of putting together a box of things which they might need but not think of until it s too late The idea is that she can go oh s t I really need some happy cream some seething get something to wipe up the projectiles vomit all over the floor but I don t have any and all the shops are shut then she can just pull out the box and get the emergency supplies to tide her over until she can get to a shop So far I have CalpolKids vapour rubBepanthenLanolin creamSaline nasal sprayEmergency nappiesAntibacterial hand gelDisposable bed mats in case of multiple sick leads in the Moses basket etc baby wipesTeething gelTeetha seething granulesBaby wiped promised formulaMuslinsColic dropsNipple shield Can anyone think of anything else that might be needed at am when all the shops are shut I ,5,13,1,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

micapainter,"I am desperate for help. My sister has been behaving strangely since the birth of her son last year. It all started with my dad and how she cut him off over a silly argument they had because he didn't call her to congratulate her on the pregnancy. I now feel sorry for him as she has now been treating the rest of our family the same. Twisting things that have been said and saying some really nasty and cruel things to me and my mum. My mum is heartbroken as she now can't see her grandson. My sister has always been quite a volatile character but this pregnancy seems to have turned her into a monster. We have not been nasty to her but she takes tiny things we say the wrong way and sees things that aren;t there. I tried to gently broach the topic of her emotions and possible pnd but she flew at me and has now blocked be and my mum on Facebook. She returns my mum's presents saying they aren't to her taste and not what she asked for. My Aunt sent her a card but my sister told her she is a great Aunt not just aunt, really petty things. My mum has tried to get in touch with her husband and in-laws but they ignore her messages and then go straight to my sister which then makes things worse as she attacks my mum for going behind her back.I was just reading another post from a concerned sister and she described her behaviour the same. If my sister won't seek help or admit there is anything wrong with her what can be done? I have told my mum to give her space and maybe she will calm down? It has been 10 months since my sister gave birth. I have tried every approach possible with my sister but you'd be shocked at some of the things she has said. It feels like she is deliberately pushing us away and she always likes to play the victim.My mum is going to cut her out of her will if things don't improve by the end of the year. i'd also be fine not having anything to do with my sister but it's the thought of never seeing my nephew that breaks my heart.

WorrisomeHeart,"I was diagnosed with PND when my first son was about 3 weeks old. A traumatic birth, ending in EMCS, NNU stay for DS, failure to establish breastfeeding and a basic shock at how everything had turned out meant I was in a very bad way for his early weeks. I was lucky in that I had a very aware midwife as my PN support and she got me to the GP who diagnosed and prescribed a low dose of fluoxetine. That helped to get me back onto an even keel, and I then joined a PND support group which I found so beneficial. By the end of the support group, (when DS was about 6 months old) I felt almost back to myself again. I was very wary when I was pregnant with my second DS, I made sure I had the support networks in place, had a planned section to avoid further birth trauma, and luckily didn't relapse. I still feel incredibly guilty about DS1's first days. But the support group helped me to realise that it wasn't my fault, that it wasn't something I could control, that I could bond with my son and form a loving and caring relationship with him despite the bad days.

After I knew all of this I just relaxed more, knew it would pass and felt confident enough to gave another baby which was a massive deal for me.

Marzie88," I've only just realised 4 years on that I had PND, my mood swings were uncontrollable, I was insecure, paranoid and so irrational- I used to accuse my partner of cheating all the time.

Marquand,"I'm not only on Venlafaxine, by also on a secondary drug, Lamotragine. This is my third pregnancy on medication, and my older kids are fine.

anna8315,"Hello guys, Probably this will be a long post. I am not a native English speaker so please understand if I am not writing perfect. I suffered from depression since week 5. When I found out I was pregnant i was lucky for only one week but then my doubts and fear and anxiety started. When the tiredness and nausea started I still was very positive as i thought I would feel so low and negative because of this. In week 12 it starts to get better but i was still so worse and scared if I really wanted the baby. I have to say i was not long with my boyfriend together and he could not manage my depression. I was almost every day home in bed, attended some family events and things I had to do. When I started to consider abortion my boyfriend just left me alone with the decision, he even said it is my decision.( my personality changed complete, i was not a good person and I even thought I did not like him anymore). I was becoming desperate and went to abortion clinics but always had break downs to really do it. Thre weeks past and my little baby was growing further and I even got more depressed. Then two days ago we went in a clinic and made a abortion at 14 week. I was crying when I did so I think actually of all the hormons i was not able to realise anymore what I am doing here. My boyfriend just looked and said nothing to me. Now I am completely sad, crying the whole day, went into psychiatric clinic where they gave me medication. There were so many pregnant womon getting help and they sometimes even stay in hospital for some time to be treated. The doctor said I would have been treated with medication during pregnancy but I missed this chance. I feel soo much guilt and such a big loose, like a good friend of mine has died. I can not get over it, also had suicidal tendences but I will be treated in hospital. I want to say to you guys, don't ever make an abortion du to depression and anxiety, it will be soo much worser afterwards. I killed my little baby and my bf did not even say something about it. He is regretting a lot and said it was the biggest mistake he has ever done because he thought i would feel better after the abortion. I went to some doctors before and said i am depressed but nobody took it for real. Just understand you have to talk to people like midwife or even go in the psychatric clinic they will help you immediately. For my baby it is now to late and i made a big mistake. I am constantly crying over the loos my strong family is behind me (they did not knew that I suffered from depression trough pregnancy, as I felt ashamed to tell them) and will support me trough this hard times in life. If god will give me a second chance than I will do everything to just keep the baby what ever it takes. Hopefully god is forgivinf me for what I have done.",Hullo guns Probably this will be a long post I am not a native English speaker so please understand if I am not writing perfect I suffered from depression since week When I found out I was pregnant i was lucky for only one week but then my doubts and fear and anxiety started When the tiredness and nausea started I still was very positive as i thought I would feel so low and negative because of this In week it starts to get better but i was still so worse and scared if I really wanted the baby I have to say i was not long with my boyfriend together and he could not manage my depression I was almost every day home in bed attended some family events and things I had to do When I started to consider abortion my boyfriend just left me alone with the decision he even said it is my decision my personality changed complete i was not a good person and I even thought I did not like him anymore I was becoming desperate and went to abortion clinics but always had break down to really do it The weeks past and my little baby was growing further and I even got more depressed Then two days ago we went in a clinic and made a abortion at week I was crying when I did so I think actually of all the harmony i was not able to realise anymore what I am doing here My boyfriend just looked and said nothing to me Now I am completely sad crying the whole day went into psychiatric clinic where they gave me meditation There were so many pregnant women getting help and they sometimes even stay in hospital for some time to be treated The doctor said I would have been treated with meditation during pregnancy but I missed this chance I feel so much guilt and such a big loose like a good friend of mine has died I can not get over it also had suicidal tendencies but I will be treated in hospital I want to say to you guns don t ever make an abortion du to depression and anxiety it will be so much worse afterwards I killed my little baby and my of did not even say something about it He is regretting a lot and said it was the biggest mistake he has ever done because he thought i would feel better after the abortion I went to some doctors before and said i am depressed but nobody took it for real Just understand you have to talk to people like midwife or even go in the psychiatric clinic they will help you immediately For my baby it is now to late and i made a big mistake I am constantly crying over the look my strong family is behind me they did not knew that I suffered from depression trough pregnancy as I felt ashamed to tell them and will support me trough this hard times in life If god will give me a second chance than I will do everything to just keep the baby what ever it takes hopefully god is forgiving me for what I have done ,1,22,8,10,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

PastysPrincess, I didn't have depression before I had my son but its the same condition whether you have it before or after children. I really would recommend seeing a doctor and getting referred for some counselling. My therapist has already told me she can write it into my notes that certain things can be done a certain way if I were to have another child. Once they know about your condition steps should be put in place to support you if were to have another baby. So for example I will be able to have an elective c section as facing another labour would be too much for me to deal with.,I didn t have depression before I had my son but its the same condition whether you have it before or after children I really would recommend seeing a doctor and getting referred for some counselling My therapist has already told me she can write it into my notes that certain things can be done a certain way if I were to have another child Once they know about your condition steps should be put in place to support you if were to have another baby So for example I will be able to have an elective c section as facing another labour would be too much for me to deal with ,2,23,8,17,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I promise you, if you just take it one day at a time and seek help you can get better.

anna8315,"Hi Tonijo,I am sorry to hear that you feel so heart broken after the termination. There are probably no words that would help you right now but I can tell you time will heal the pain and you have done what was best for you in this situation. I believe that many timea our inner voice is telling us straight away what is right and wrong but during pregnancy there are so many different hormones in your body that somtimes you don't know what is right. I also think you have done the right decision as you felt you could not handle the third and yes a third baby is probably lots of work again especially when your partner is not really part of the family live.

Blossomdeary,Ante natal depression is a serious illness - I watched a loved one go through this. She too was so ill that she contemplated termination. It is a dreadful illness and I am so sorry that you have had to suffer this. It is also a random illness and having suffered it once does not mean you would necessarily have the same problem in a subsequent pregnancy - and if it did you would know that you can get the proper help in the form of medication. It must have been doubly hard for you to find your way round the system if English is not your first language.You will in time be able to put this behind you - it is all a bit raw just now.

anna8315,"Hello guys, Probably this will be a long post. I am not a native English speaker so please understand if I am not writing perfect. I suffered from depression since week 5. When I found out I was pregnant i was lucky for only one week but then my doubts and fear and anxiety started. When the tiredness and nausea started I still was very positive as i thought I would feel so low and negative because of this. In week 12 it starts to get better but i was still so worse and scared if I really wanted the baby. I have to say i was not long with my boyfriend together and he could not manage my depression. I was almost every day home in bed, attended some family events and things I had to do. When I started to consider abortion my boyfriend just left me alone with the decision, he even said it is my decision.( my personality changed complete, i was not a good person and I even thought I did not like him anymore). I was becoming desperate and went to abortion clinics but always had break downs to really do it. Thre weeks past and my little baby was growing further and I even got more depressed. Then two days ago we went in a clinic and made a abortion at 14 week. I was crying when I did so I think actually of all the hormons i was not able to realise anymore what I am doing here. My boyfriend just looked and said nothing to me. Now I am completely sad, crying the whole day, went into psychiatric clinic where they gave me medication. There were so many pregnant womon getting help and they sometimes even stay in hospital for some time to be treated. The doctor said I would have been treated with medication during pregnancy but I missed this chance. I feel soo much guilt and such a big loose, like a good friend of mine has died. I can not get over it, also had suicidal tendences but I will be treated in hospital. I want to say to you guys, don't ever make an abortion du to depression and anxiety, it will be soo much worser afterwards. I killed my little baby and my bf did not even say something about it. He is regretting a lot and said it was the biggest mistake he has ever done because he thought i would feel better after the abortion. I went to some doctors before and said i am depressed but nobody took it for real. Just understand you have to talk to people like midwife or even go in the psychatric clinic they will help you immediately. For my baby it is now to late and i made a big mistake. I am constantly crying over the loos my strong family is behind me (they did not knew that I suffered from depression trough pregnancy, as I felt ashamed to tell them) and will support me trough this hard times in life. If god will give me a second chance than I will do everything to just keep the baby what ever it takes.

anna8315,"CaprigalPlease don't make the abortion in such a mental state. For me it sounds you really wanted the baby. I know it can make you soo confuse when your inner voice is telling you there is something wrong and termination is the only way out. When I had the abortion, i felt sooo empty afterwards. My really happy life was dark and grey and honestly do you know how really bad heart break after a splitting up from your big love felt? So just imagine this feeling afterwards. I was trashed after the abortion, i did mine in week 14/15 (12 weeks after conceiving). Please don't make a rushed decision when your mind is not clear! I really beg you overthink and then think if your hormons could make you a different persons or your maybe scared. Fear is our worst enemy. Hope you are doing the right thing. Don't get me wrong, it is all your decision and nobody can tell you what is best for you but if you wanted that child and have seen sonogrammes already in week 12 i beg you please don't terminate! You will regret and suffer for quite a while. I wish you all the best for the decision which is best for you! Lizzi, i was not on medication during pregnancy just after the termination it called Tavor in German, i took it only 3 weeks and then i went off.

blondebuddha,"Not quite sure where to start or what it is that I'm looking to get out of this post so might just be rambling for abit hoping it makes me feel better. I'm in a situation where I know I should go and see my gp about depression but I can't bring myself to do it. I hate them, I've never had a good experience with doctors and I just can't imagine what I'm supposed to say, never mind what their reaction would be. How can i go in and explain what's wrong if I don't know what's wrong in the first place? I think it started when I was teenager and it never completely went away, I self harmed a lot but it's 10 years at least since I've come close to doing that again. Having a baby has really fucked my head up but I honestly don't understand why. My daughter is amazing. Being a Mum is hard and exhausting and bewildering but amazing. And I see this gorgeous little thing that I managed to create and I'm fucking ignoring her because I'm too busy sitting on the bed crying. She's learnt to bring me a tissue when I'm crying because it's just a regular occurrence for mummy to be abit sad and she fucking cuddles me and brings me a teddy because she knows that's what makes her happy and then she'll go off and play with her toys or get her crayons out and she thinks nothing of playing on her own because that's how it's always been. And then I'll get more upset at myself but I still can't bring myself to do anything about it because my brain just tells me that im a disgrace and there's no point anyway. I've tried to talk to my own mum about it to see if she felt like this with me but I get nothing. I've been bought up with depression being something that is made up by people who don't want to go to work. It's something that people should just stop feeling because you've got nothing bad happening and there's kids starving in Africa and they always smile so why can't I. I can be fine for a while. Might be days or might be a couple of hours like this morning and then it just sneaks up on you. Something little might start it off today like my face looked all blotchy and horrible even after I tried to hide it with make up and then I noticed how fat I looked and that I need to go up a trousers size again even after I spent ages losing all that weight. I put weight on because I found out I was pregnant a little while ago and ate all the foods I wanted to and made plans of new babies and names and colours and due dates and shit and then I lost it and I couldn't talk to anyone because no one knew and I felt like I wasn't allowed to grieve because it wasn't a baby or a thing it was just cells and bits and everyone kept telling me how it could have been really bad but it was fucking really bad. I've decided I'm not going to go back and read what I've written and change it all I just need to post it so people can read it and probably tell me I need to see a doctor. I don't feel any better for writing that and I really wish I did. It has made me think that maybe it's pnd and then I was perhaps doing ok but I had a miscarriage and it's come back again. My husbands going to come home and tell that I've been crying and I hate it when that happens He tried really hard and I feel like I'm letting him down too. He never knows if he's coming home to me being a horrible bastard in a mood or the version that is doing ok and is on top of the housework and the kids and everyone is fine. Now I just feel really deflated and empty like I've got everything off my chest and I'm not sure where to go from here. I'm sorry to anyone that reads all that bollocks. Thanks though.

Nikki2ol6," Yes he has 3 things wrong he has DORV, a large VSD and cortation of the aorta. So basically both main vessels are in the same side of his heart, there is a large hole in his heart allowing all the blood to mix so he will get some oxygen blood but the vessel which takes the oxygen blood around the body has a slim point. That would need opened up very soon after birth, and the rest would need sorted by open heart surgery before his first birthday. The extra scans are to see if the aorta becomes any slimmer or if the side of the heart with no vessels in starts to shut down but as of my last scan both sides of the heart were the same size so that was good they said. I have other children too who were very excited about this baby and he's due at new year and we were all so exited but everything is falling apart. We won't know exactly how badly this slim aorta will effect him until he try's to breath and we see how much oxygen blood he gets round his body but he is to be taken away as soon as his cord is cut which they said they will leave the cord attached for 3 minuets and I get to hold him for those 3 minuets then that's it xx",Yes he has things wrong he has OR a large So and formation of the aorta So basically both main vessels are in the same side of his heart there is a large hole in his heart allowing all the blood to mix so he will get some oxygen blood but the vessel which takes the oxygen blood around the body has a slim point That would need opened up very soon after birth and the rest would need sorted by open heart surgery before his first birthday The extra scars are to see if the aorta becomes any glimmer or if the side of the heart with no vessels in starts to shut down but as of my last scan both sides of the heart were the same size so that was good they said I have other children too who were very excited about this baby and he s due at new year and we were all so excited but everything is falling apart We won t know exactly how badly this slim aorta will effect him until he try s to breath and we see how much oxygen blood he gets round his body but he is to be taken away as soon as his cord is cut which they said they will leave the cord attached for minutes and I get to hold him for those minutes then that s it ex ,2,4,10,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nikki2ol6, Thank you for your reply. We have been to the cardiac intensive care unit and we're shown around and what to expect and such. It's all so daunting all those extremely poorly babies just lying there with so many wires and tubes and surrounded by machines. I'm trying to enjoy my pregnancy but I feel detached from my baby in a way that I can't explain. I think perhaps it's some sort of defence thing people have after being told something is wrong with their baby. Did you feel this way too?? How is your baby now??

rubyrooster,Good evening ladies. Looking for a little bit of help. When I was pregnant with my first I started to suffer with depression and anxiety. Since he was born it got a lot worse and I was put on tablets.Now on my second pregnancy and was taken off escitalopram and put on fluoxetine. Fluoxetine isn't helping and they have put me back on escitalopram. I was told it's not safe for the baby as it's at more risk with this one but then this other dr has said it's fine.

Katieboobah1976,"Hi, I think you sound nothing like a horrible person with anger issues. And very normal as a pregnant mum of 1! I myself have had post natal depression with both my children 3 and 1 now and was diagnosed sertraline, though stopped taking them about 6 months back. I however quite often get angry like you at the smallest thing. I either lash out (not violently) at inanimate objects or cry uncontrollably in front of someone, even though they aren't to blame for anything. The worst thing with depression is you feel all this anger, then feel incredibly guilty for feeling that way. I'm currently writing this as my husband is putting dd to bed after she cried so much I felt I couldn't cope and that I wish I had never been a mummy. Now she's quiet and being wonderful for daddy I hate that I could even think like that. The good news is you can always speak to your dr, they can prescribe anti depressants for when you have your baby (and I mean as soon as baby make sure an appearance) should you want to. If not they can at least point you in the direction of someone you can talk to, so you can off load. Remember you have so many hormones going round so you are entitled to feel all over the place. A lot of the problem is stigma, we aren't supposed to feel angry are we? Us mums are supposed to be cool, calm and patient. You are doing a great job, but do chat to your dr or midwife, you'll be surprised what support you will find.

EmilyRosanne,"I have two children, my youngest being 4 months old. With my first I vaguely remember the being tired/grumpy stage but nothing like this. However we have had a rough start with second DC and not sure if how I feel is just a normal reaction to it all or something more..My pregnancy wasn't easy with her and after some complications she was delivered a little early and spent two weeks in special care. It was a week before I was able to try and breastfeed her which I felt affected our bond initially as she felt more of the nurses baby than my own and I felt my relationship with my first born (4 yo) really suffered and as I am still breastfeeding I don't feel like we have a lot of time together anymore which makes me feel a little resentful. The baby was diagnosed with something (won't go into too much detail incase I identify myself) that will massivEly affect her life and means she needs lots of extra care day to day. When I talk to anyone about how I feel they are sympathetic but say it's understandable considering what we have been through but I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. My DP is of no help and just asks why I'm 'always in a strop'. I am constantly crying or snapping at the children and feel like we made a mistake having a second child and feel guilty that my eldest misses out on so much because of it.

julfin,"Sorry for what you're going through, and sorry you haven't had any responses here yet.I had post-natal anxiety rather than depression, so can't shed any light on the symptoms of depression. But I'd strongly recommend talking to your GP and getting their advice/support. It's also worth self-referring yourself for mental health support (which might involve cognitive behavioural therapy on your own, or group therapy/wellbeing sessions). You can withdraw at any stage of the process if you decide it's not for you or if you no longer feel you need it, but it's definitely worth exploring what's available. Meds or therapy (or both) could make a world of difference.Just because it's understandable doesn't mean it's bearable. Don't try to struggle through alone.

MrsBlennerhassett, it does sound like youve been through a lot so could just be a natural reaction but if you are worried speak to your GP. I had PND and was put on anti depressants (amytriptalyne) that were safe to take and breastfeed. Do talk to someone other than your husband who also is probably very stressed so will maybe not be as sympathetic as he should be. To give my experience of PND i used to cry pretty much all day for the first six months of my sons life. However a year on i was completely fine and back to normal. So please dont worry that if you do have PND that you made a mistake in having another child and its going to affect your mental health forever because that is unlikely to the case. And as i said i think anyone would be very stressed and emotional in your situation. 4 months is not long after giving birth at all. Be kind to yourself.xxx,it does sound like you been through a lot so could just be a natural reaction but if you are worried speak to your Go I had No and was put on anti depressants amytriptalyne that were safe to take and breasted Do talk to someone other than your husband who also is probably very stressed so will maybe not be as sympathetic as he should be To give my experience of No i used to cry pretty much all day for the first six months of my sons life However a year on i was completely fine and back to normal So please dont worry that if you do have No that you made a mistake in having another child and its going to affect your mental health forever because that is unlikely to the case And as i said i think anyone would be very stressed and emotional in your situation months is not long after giving birth at all Be kind to yourself six ,6,3,12,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Chemistria,"Hi Sorry if this comes across as being bluntIn a lesbian relationship we have one child already. I'm 29 weeks pregnant and OH is 14 weeks pregnant through IVF. I never ever thought it was a good idea from the start, for us both to be pregnant at the same time but she was adamant we could cope. She's been trying for well over 2 years to get pregnant, had a blighted ovum in Jan 15. So anyway, she had IVF in August and the first few weeks were bloody stressful because she kept bleeding on and off until 12 weeks, and we thought so many times she was losing it. About 10 weeks she started feeling very nauseous and 11 weeks started being sick quite badly and has been diagnosed with HG after a hospital stay and drip she's on meds now. What I'm really worried about is she says daily she wishes she wasn't pregnant, she feels nothing towards it, hopes she has a miscarriage, considering abortion, and I'm sick of hearing it. She says she's happy about MY pregnancy , we are having a little girl, but doesn't want hers. I can't help but feel anger and disappointment towards her. It's not like this happened by accident. And the child might not be anything to do with me biologically but I already have feelings towards it, as I do towards my own. Does this sound like depression or that she's just ....

I am doing a lot better as I dont cry all the time and feel awful all the time.But I have lots more to do and I still feel there is something wrong with this baby.It is very hard also when people talk about babies all the time and ask me how the baby is all the time. I cant stand it. People think that because you are pregnant you are so happy and in love with the baby but the hidden truth is that a lot of us dont feel that way.She must be in a very bad place and doctor did offer me medication but I chose therapy and I am seeing him again today to reassess. You need to find a sympathetic doctor or a midwife. Also search for counselling in your borough, in my county they offer on line free counselling.There is light at the end of the tunnel, I dont see it yet but now at least I believe there is.The suicide comments... Those are never a joke. I have been there in the past and I never meant to follow through but when you say that is because all the joy and hope you had has been removed. Don't take them lightly, it is a call for help. I am NOT saying she will harm herself, I am saying she is hurting. As much as someone can hurt.Good luck OP ",Hi I just wanted to post here because I am dealing with a lot mentally during this pregnancy and I got lots of support from ladies here and I wanted to give some back I am sorry you feel so lonely in your pregnancy I felt lonely too but now Do is being great Your On in my non expert opinion seems to be suffering from antenatal depression and I know you are focused on not losing the baby but you need to focus on how she is feeling I didn want my baby all of a sudden You can read my post in the pregnancy forum called I dont want this baby because you might find answers to a lot I got lots of tips there I just stopped loving this baby and told my Do I didn want it and he was so worried about the abortion but I said it was lawfully my decision and so it is hers I called midwife and I saw Go and they told me who to contact and I started therapy I am doing a lot better as I dont cry all the time and feel awful all the time But I have lots more to do and I still feel there is something wrong with this baby It is very hard also when people talk about babies all the time and ask me how the baby is all the time I can stand it People think that because you are pregnant you are so happy and in love with the baby but the hidden truth is that a lot of us dont feel that way She must be in a very bad place and doctor did offer me meditation but I chose therapy and I am seeing him again today to assess You need to find a sympathetic doctor or a midwife Also search for counselling in your borough in my county they offer on line free counselling There is light at the end of the tunnel I dont see it yet but now at least I believe there is The suicide comments Those are never a joke I have been there in the past and I never meant to follow through but when you say that is because all the joy and hope you had has been removed Don t take them lightly it is a call for help I am NOT saying she will harm herself I am saying she is hurting As much as someone can hurt Good luck On ,3,2,11,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Caprigal,"Thank you ,I just hope they can help me to make sense of it. I wasn't happy when I found out I was pregnant but I think the pregnancy had already triggered the depression at that point. I was ok for a week or so then the nausea started which I have 24/7 just like I did with my first pregnancy , I sleep as much as I can around my 2 year old which helps and it's the only thing that does help . I'm on medication for the sickness but it's not a great help. I have found I don't want the baby more when I'm not coping with the sickness. I think I just really hate been pregnant and with it been Christmas time , a lot of my plans have been cancelled which makes me resentful. Luckily over the past few days I seem to be coping better ,although I was in tears most of the day yesterday because I could barely move for feeling so ill and I told my husband last night that I wanted a termination asap. I do think when you are really ill and hormones are all over you feel ten times worse for it. I had a traumatic pregnancy and labour the first time around too so don't think that's helped at all. It wasn't so bad seeing my friend as she knows what I'm going through and we stayed away from the baby conversation. Don't worry about not understanding it because I think it's one of those things, that unless you've been through it or are close to someone that's been there it is hard to understand. Even myself now I read some of the things I put on paper and think,what a selfish mare get over it! But it's not that easy at all.

Imavinoops,"HelloMy partner is convinced I need to go to the doctor as he thinks I have Antenatal Depression.

This past week has been horrible really, DP and I have argued loads and every day I have cried about something. I get pregnancy is an emotional time but is this normal?

I was told to come off them which I slowly have done over the past few months. I moved (with my 4year old) 6months ago to a new town to be with my partner of 2years. All I want to do is run away.....I feel so miserable. I don't know whether it's because I've come off my tablets or if I'm genuinely unhappy. My partner doesn't understand my depression and makes me feel so alone on a daily basis......i don't know if I feel the same about him anymore. I have no family and friends in my new location and travelling for 1.5 hours to see anyone is horrible. I'm convinced I should just pack everything and move back home to where things are familiar but I'm terrified.

Imnotmyself," I'm in a similar place, but not the same. My youngest starts school next September and the third one is due beginning Dec. I have not come to terms with this pregnancy at all. I knew before I did the test that it was a huge mistake and realised how finished with it all I felt. I don't know how I will survive the next few years. Early miscarriage last year made me think this was what I wanted. It is not. Also my sister had three and I was often told by my own mum how much better she coped 'without any support'.

Do try not to worry that you'll definitely get depressed, although there's no harm keeping an eye on it and having a plan in place.

Also try to bare in mind that you are likely to be able to cope just fine and have confidence that if you do feel that you're struggling in any way you are already on top of it and prepared to ask for help.

SeaFlute,"I had PND even though I didn't expect it. I had severe HG and SPD when pregnant so was virtually housebound for 9months. I assumed the joy at not being sick and being able to walk pain-free would make me ecstatic after the birth. What happened was I felt overwhelmed, very anxious and couldn't face going out alone for some time. It took a few months before I felt physically and mentally well again and started to enjoy motherhood.I wish I'd had treatment for PND earlier but I thought it was just baby blues. I used to cry throughout the day and was irrationally angry at the world. I felt like I was drowning.What helped: friends, meds, getting out with baby in sling (I couldn't manage the pram initially), buying baby clothes, visits from family, my wonderful NCT group who insisted I signed up for lots of groups and classes with them and picked us up when I couldn't face the bus. I used to go to my friends house and ask her to hold my baby for a bit, while I held hers (mine cried most of the day due to reflux and colic but holding her calmer baby made me realise it wasn't something I was doing wrong)! We became very close and supported each other through some tough times.I suggest having a chat with your GP and midwife about how you feel now, to get a support plan in place. Do you have local friends or an NCT group? Is your HV good? Mine came weekly for a while as I didn't feel able to get to a clinic for counselling.

Rebocalucy,"Hi all, I'll try to make it short ... My little girl is 4 months old, since she was born Iv suffered terrible anxiety and intrusive thoughts. Although I am in a better place than I was 4 months ago, I have been to the doctors numerous times. In the end I went and asked for anti depressants, I was prescribed 10mg citalopram but the doctor reluctantly gave me these as I didn't score high on the depression test. I know I am not depressed. It's my anxiety and intrusive thoughts that's the problem, and even though I'm having CBT I am just so desperate for it to go away. I spoke to my councillor who has also said she feels I don't need the pills. I constantly feel sick and scared. My mind is always racing. I'm not sleeping too bad and my baby sleeps through. We have an amazing bond and I love her dearly. I just can't relax at all. I carry on my life as usual, I have a clean organised house, I go out to the shops / friends / family. I just carry on my life with a huge black anxiety cloud over my head ! It's my first baby and although my partner hasn't been really supportive of my mental health I cried a lot yesterday and he has promised me he will support me.I just want to enjoy my baby !

cattastic, Just had to login and respond when I read your post. I also started to dissociate and go into the dreamlike state you describe (it's due to high anxiety) and suffered badly with PND after the birth of my child. I was eventually hospitalised for 2 months in a mother and baby unit as it all became too much for me. Am now much much better but still take a lot of medication. There is light at the end of the tunnel but I really think you need specialist help as detachment/dissociation is seriously exhausting to live with and it made me (briefly) suicidal in the end. You might not become as badly affected as I was but I would ask your gp to refer you to your specialist perinatal mental health team. I wouldn't wish PND on anyone. It was/is horrendous.

I have always wanted children, I would often dream about being pregnant and wake up disappointed to realised that I'm not. However now that I know I am pregnant the reality is so very different. My mood is very very low and I feel anxious all the time. My partner is pleased about the pregnancy, but I don't feel that he understands how absolutely low I feel. It doesn't help that I feel very very poorly with morning sickness. We also do not live near my family, and I really feel like I need my Mom right now. I feel very lonely and isolated. This isn't how I imagined pregnancy at all and that in its self is depressing and I feel a huge amount of guilt for not being thrilled to be pregnant.

Awakendreamin," Your post really resonated with me as I'm going through much of the same experiences. 6 weeks along now and I've only known for less than 2 weeks. When I saw those two lines on the test I immediately started crying and felt overwhelmed. I went a couple days of feeling a bit in disbelief but once my doctor confirmed pregnancy for sure, I went downhill from there. We were not trying to get pregnant per se, but we were starting to be a little bit less strict on the protection, thinking maybe ""one day"" in the next year it might happen for us. Little did I know that it would happen SO fast. I wish I had that year back, that I could do a bit more traveling and cross some more things off my bucket list before this. I've been in such a horrible funk, cannot seem to stop crying, anxiety and depression is a constant and the only break is dragging myself to work where no one knows and won't ask me about it. I go back in forth in my mind between thinking that maybe with some therapy I could do this vs terminating the pregnancy (I know, this sounds horrible and believe me I feel that way about myself).

Imnotmyself," I've no idea whether this is the beginning of prenatal depression, have you told your midwife / GP how you are feeling? For what it's worth I am currently being 'looked after' by a mental health OT because I can't cope mentally with my pregnancy - but it's my third and my situation seems very different from yours. I had no issues with the first two, and when I had my first I was living in a city 7 hours drive from both sets of grandparents (in different directions) and although my husband had a wide circle of friends and had lived here for over a decade, I had only lived here for 3 years at the time and all of my friends lived elsewhere. I had no true friends to speak of at work and had a handful of acquaintances that I met up with once a week. I was a bit worried in my first pregnancy about friendships but actually it was fine. I plucked up the courage to invite someone from antenatal classes round for coffee and she is still a friend to this day. I also made it my aim to go to one group a day just to get out of the house. I am also not good in social situations - I am very quiet and shy and was always the kid who didn't have a partner for PE - that kind of thing, so I am no social butterfly.

LMST,Hi allAfter many forwards and backwards discussions with my GP (rock and a hard place comes to mind) I decided to come of vital pram when I first found out I was pregnant. First 6 weeks wee vert tough with withdrawal (dizzy tingly) but those physical symptoms passed. Mood wise it's hard though. Up and down but the downs are like endurance battles I have to plough through. I've decided to try and make it through without medication. In second trimester now and I'm questioning my decision daily. The tablets sit in my drawer and wait. DH supportive and says just take them you can't go on feeling like this. Sister says you can't do it think of the baby. GP says only you can make the decision. Refered to the maternity psychiatrist. He pointed out that me being depressed also poses risks to the baby (Arg! ) so need to consider which risk I'm more able to take. Ground hog day. It's so tough. I guess this is the beginning of the responsibilities of being a parent. Putting your child before yourself. Trouble is I hardly want this baby now.

LMST,"It's a really tough decision this one. The evidence around risks of taking it is conflicting but you just say to yourself 'oh come on tough it out for just the next 9 months or you might regret it'.Hmm. Why are we so horrible to ourselves!!?So I came off it when found out pregnant. First 8 weeks was very hard but then the second trimester was REALLY good. I felt great and really happy I'd made the decision to go drug free. Then things deteriorated about week 25 (a particularly stressful period at work exacerbated things for me so don't take this as me saying that third trimester will be the pits for everyone)I still wanted to be drug free. And to stay at work. Not clever. I got so ill that I stopped eating properly, had to reduce my hours at work and eventually was signed off altogether by the Occupational Health doctor who frankly told me I was very very unwell and needed to look after myself. So on advice of my team I went back on the citalopram. What I'm trying to say here is that we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to not take medication based on some evidence that there MIGHT be effect on baby but we end up causing ourselves a lot of distress. So many women take citalopram and goodness knows how many other essential treatments during pregnancy without any il effect. If you had a physical condition that meant you absolutely had to take medication to stay well you would. Why don't we cut ourselves the same slack on mental health? (Yeah, I know).Anyway I've got 3 weeks to go now and I have finally accepted three things:I have a mental illness and I owe it to myself and my partner to be responsible and accept treatment to manage itTrying to function in the workplace or socially with untreated depression is incredibly hard and will wear you down to exhaustion (not great if you're also trying to grow a baby)Although there is huge pressure to breastfeed I have made the decision to not breastfeed so that I can increase medication as soon as baby born- this gives me the best chance of coping and being a good mum, and I should not feel bad about this.I hope this helps- there is no perfect answer here but please do cut yourselves some slack. Anxiety and low mood are horrible to live through- be kind to yourself.

Asia88,"I remember being more or less unhappy for big chunks of my life since early childhood. My extremely abusive father (both physically and mentally) and perverted cousin had something to do with it, but also the on and off bullying I got at school and almost chronic struggle with making and maintaining friendships. I don't want you to think my life has been overall pathetic though. I have always been very ambitious and a high achiever, a junior national champion in running, with good grades at school across the board, learnt another language fluently, modelled for a short while, migrated for uni and in the end got a first class degree. So on the surface I look like an attractive, successful well balanced professional... Yet I've been pushing hard always trying, but in the process being more & more unhappy.I feel I've been chasing some dream of the perfect me, holding myself to high standards but experienced increased rejection from people I cared about in the process and under appreciation for all that I've done as a friend, lover and just cruelty that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.I am not going to write out my entire life's story but it has all been rather traumatic on me inside.I feel like all I ever wanted and done was to get appreciation, respect in a form of a loving partner, a fun group of friends. But that is one thing that I could never get in life.It makes me so depressed that the 3 former partners I really loved don't even talk to me now and I know they are of the view that I'm crazy/psycho/controlling weirdo. I feel I gave these guys all my heart and they just didn't care at all and don't care now. All my behaviours were caused because I genuinely loved them so much it hurts me that I'm viewed with no compassion, as if I'm not even a real person just some label. I'm someone they don't think about for a second in their day to day lives (happy with new girlfriends as far as I can see on social media) and if they do by mistake they probably articulate a quite ""good riddance!""And now on top of that I've also managed to loose a handful of friends I had locally. I stopped talking to some of them, one in particular because she was always deliberately putting me down - duh I should have known better I didn't have such luxury as to pick and choose even if others are vile to me , as now I'm completely on my own.I try to make connections with people all around me suggesting get togethers, lunches, starting random chats here and there. I'm like bloody Teflon - nothing sticks! I always make the effort to be an entertaining conversationalist, I am NEVER negative as here - it's like a bloody curse or something.I told some small part this to my own mum who said ""ah yeah because you are unpleasant"" I'm like seriously WTF - what? I'm really trying my best here why do people think that of me and treat me like that!?! I try to smile at strangers, engage in small talk, do everything right. When I love people or friends with them I give my all. I don't know what more I can do and what the hell is wrong with me.Please don't say ""just relax"" because I did just that last year and this just resulted in me continuing to have no friends outside my current partner.Am I some inherently shitty person that 80% who come across me think I'm not worth the time? Or that I'm ""unpleasant"" or mean? Duh I even had it on this forum where I asked a question about something and half of the respondents accused me of attention seeking and enjoying the situation.I don't know what to do anymore. I don't enjoy anything and I don't feel motivated for anything I keep pushing but it's all so frustrating because I don't even know what I'm pushing for.

Cinnamon2013," My baby is 7 months old, I also have a 3 year old. I've been feeling down and anxious for about three months and got the diagnosis when I finally saw the GP this week. I don't know what I'm posting for really, maybe just to feel like I'm not alone. I feel in some ways freed by the diagnosis, in some ways labelled (stigmatised?). I'm on the waiting list for counselling. I feel quite numb. I don't know where to go from here and whether I will be happier again. I'm finding trying to restart work again (I work for myself) nigh-on impossible. I'd love to hear from someone on the other side.

Brian24,"Hello everyoneI would really appreciate if anyone could give me any help or guidance.We had our second son seven months ago and since he was born my wife has been struggling with post natal depression. She had been to the doctors and has been prescribed medication but it did not appear to be working. It has been getting progressively worse, her moods are unpredictable and she is angry all the time. She can go from relatively happy to lethargic and tired, to uncontrollably angry and aggressive. She loses her temper and tells me that she is losing control, this has been escalating over the last couple of weeks where she told me that she can’t cope and that she has suicidal thoughts daily.I have no idea how to help her, I have suggested that we both go to the doctor and talk it through together. I have tried to be supportive however everything I do, I am accused of talking down to her or pedantic. I asked her about her tablets that she has been taking, she told me that she goes through stages where she takes them and then she will stop. I’m not sure if this is having a negative effect, I doubt that the tablets would work if this is the case.I love my wife and want to help her in any way that I can, I am sure that I am not the perfect husband at times and I do have my faults but I try my best. I work reasonably long hours but always make sure I’m home to feed and bath the boys before bed. I also try and give her time to herself by taking the boys out on a Saturday or Sunday among other things. I am willing to try anything to make her happy, so any suggestions would be welcomed?I do have a series of concerns:Should I be acting on her suicidal thoughts? How can I help her, she seems to despise me at the moment, everything I say seems to make her worse and more angry?It feels really serious can I force her to the doctor again, I know this wouldn’t be right but I am worried?I feel so lucky to have my wife and she has given me two beautiful boys, I just want her to get through this she’s my best friend.Many thanksBrian",Hullo everyone would really appreciate if anyone could give me any help or guidance We had our second son seven months ago and since he was born my wife has been struggling with post fatal depression She had been to the doctors and has been prescribed meditation but it did not appear to be working It has been getting progressively worse her moods are predictable and she is angry all the time She can go from relatively happy to lethargy and tired to uncontrollably angry and aggressive She loses her temper and tells me that she is losing control this has been excavating over the last couple of weeks where she told me that she can cope and that she has suicidal thoughts daily I have no idea how to help her I have suggested that we both go to the doctor and talk it through together I have tried to be suppurative however everything I do I am accused of talking down to her or pedantic I asked her about her tablets that she has been taking she told me that she goes through stages where she takes them and then she will stop I not sure if this is having a negative effect I doubt that the tablets would work if this is the case I love my wife and want to help her in any way that I can I am sure that I am not the perfect husband at times and I do have my faults but I try my best I work reasonably long hours but always make sure I home to feed and bath the boys before bed I also try and give her time to herself by taking the boys out on a Saturday or Sunday among other things I am willing to try anything to make her happy so any suggestions would be welcomed I do have a series of concerns Should I be acting on her suicidal thoughts How can I help her she seems to despise me at the moment everything I say seems to make her worse and more angry It feels really serious can I force her to the doctor again I know this wouldn be right but I am worried I feel so lucky to have my wife and she has given me two beautiful boys I just want her to get through this she my best friend Many thanksBrian ,4,6,10,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
